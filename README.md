# VFX Project
 Repository for the VFX Class where I will be making an Arrow Effect based on Ashe's Ultimate Ability (League of Legends) and Jumong's Ultimate Ability (Battlerite) ‚û∂üî•‚ùÑÔ∏è

 The visual effect is on the SampleScene scene, if you press the play button the arrow will be moving and you will be able to see the trails come out of it.
 My objective for the final stage is to get the already existing effects better looking, and to add an implosion at the start of the effect, before spawning the arrow itself and an explosion when the arrow "dies".
