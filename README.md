# VFX Project
 Repository for the VFX Class where I will be making an Arrow Effect based on Ashe's Ultimate Ability (League of Legends) and Jumong's Ultimate Ability (Battlerite) ‚û∂üî•‚ùÑÔ∏è

 The visual effect is on the SampleScene scene, if you press the play button the Visual Effect "Sequence" will show up. First thing will be an implosion, to make the player feel like there is some sort of energy getting gathered, after this effect is done, the arrow will spawn and will move forward, leaving trails and some particles/smoke behind, at last, when the arrow collides with the wall, it will destroy itself leaving an explosion.
